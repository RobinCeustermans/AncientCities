This project is a precursor/testing ground for my future project.

Here the point to have the angular app and the web app use the same database.

In the future, Ionic might be added and the ui will be updated.



To test this project:

1) Open the code in an editor such as Visual Studio
2) Open the terminal and go to Client/angular-app, inside AncientCities.Web project
3) type in ng serve
4) start up the web application (make sure that 'http' is selected and that the used url is http://localhost:5000/)
5) Open a new tab and go to this url: http://localhost:4200/  This will open up the angular app.
